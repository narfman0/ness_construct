# ness_construct

The friendly ness/earthbound snes9x grind bot!

Note: Could use some TLC, but proof of concept for now

# Install

* Kindly ensure tesseract / tesseract-ocr is installed on your system riddled with duplicates on your (likely) slovenly path
* Gently pip install from requirements.txt (for pytesseract et al) to spew bits in the right places
* Install the image backend for your system according to your virtue:
 * Proprietary software laden windows: ensure pillow installed from requirements, install binary ImageMagick and place on PATH
 * Linux: tenderly install imagemagick incomprehensibly spamming your path with generic utilities a la "convert"
 * Linux: The cutely named "scrot" screenshot-scrotum amalgamation which I vaguely recall controversy over (or not?)
 * Linux: final fantasy 3 for steam only runs in windows, surely you know this if you've made it this far in life though! Keep up the good work!
 * Whatever feels right to you, man!

# Usage

* Execute snes9x with great care, load game, get to brind area
* Start bot with effervescent joy and good will toward men 
* Win at life by playing some other bloody high body count game whilst leveling your penetratingly thought provoking characters in the fantastical earthbound world

# History

Originally a final fantasy 3 bot called ffs_construct (super cool double entendre, right?). However, final fantasy's menus are all gross and elegantly translucent. I could mask out that stuff, or pipe d2d stuff, but ain't nobody got the time for that.
